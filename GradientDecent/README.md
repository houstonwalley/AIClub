What is Gradient Descent?
Gradient Descent is an iterative method of finding the local minimum of a function.
This method follows a function based on its slope to the local minimum. It knows when
it has hit a local minimum whenever the slope is approximately 0.

The Problems:
The 2D gradient descent is for the function: y = x^2
The 3D gradient descent is for the function: z = x^2 + y^2

What I Learned:
Through these two exercises I learned what a gradient descent was and how to show it
graphically. This was my first time using matplotlib and it is an interesting tool that
allows you to show off data points in a very pleasing way.
